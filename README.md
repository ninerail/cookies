#Annaliese's Cookie Store
##A web store for girl scout cookies

Deployed on Heroku at https://dry-headland-58119.herokuapp.com/users

This is a webstore I built to help my daughter sell Girl Scout cookies. It uses Express to control MongoDB and create a persistant database of users and the cookies they ordered. Two models are employed, one for users and another for cookies (the food, not the code) that is scalable as it allows the easy addition of new varieties of cookie.
