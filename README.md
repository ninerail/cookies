#Annaliese's Cookie Store
##A web store for girl scout cookies

This is a simple webstore that uses Express to control MongoDB and create a persistant database of users and the cookies they ordered. Two models are employed, one for users and another for cookies (the food, not the software) that is scalable as it allows the easy addition of new varieties of cookie.
